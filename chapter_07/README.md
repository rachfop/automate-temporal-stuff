## Search and Replace

This program takes user input for a text string and a character to remove, and then removes all occurrences of that character from the input string## Usage

```python
poetry run python regex_search.py
```

Follow the prompts in the console to a phrase of words and then a letter to strip.

## Strong Password detector

![Demo of the application](demo_password.gif)

This is a well-written program that checks whether a password is strong or not using regular expressions. It uses the Temporal workflow library to define the workflow and activity functions, which is a good choice for implementing long-running, asynchronous tasks.

To see how to run this with encryption and a data converter, see [chapter_07_encryption](../chapter_07_encryption/).
Detector

```python
poetry run python strong_pass_word_detector.py
```
