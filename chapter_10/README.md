# Chapter 16: Coin toss

![Demo of the application](demo.gif)

This is a simple command-line program that lets users guess the outcome of a coin toss. The program generates a random result (heads or tails), compares it to the user's guess, and prints the result to the console.

## Usage

```python
poetry run python coin_toss.py
```

The program will prompt you to guess the outcome of a coin toss by entering either `heads` or `tails` and hit the Enter key.
The program will then generate a random result and compare it to your guess. The result will be printed to the console.
